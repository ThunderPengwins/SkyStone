## Thunder Pengwin Code

This is the code base for the Thunder Pengwins. Feel free to use or copy whatever. The code is forked from the official FTC Skystone repository. Some CHAD files are included, but this is not the codebase for the CHAD website itself. Code is separated by package into seasons and sometime tournaments.

## DogeCV

Several of these files pull from the DogeCV library: https://github.com/dogecv/DogeCV. The library was imported as an external Module into the project, so fully downloading this repository may cause some issues in that regard. To fix these issues, follow the install instructions on the DogeCV GitHub page to separately install via Gradle files into External Libraries.
